Task 2 – SSL/TLS in HTTPS

Website: google.com
Command used: openssl s_client -connect google.com:443

Certificate Details:
  Subject: CN=*.google.com
  Issuer: C=US, O=Google Trust Services, CN=WE2
  Validity: From Oct 13 08:37:46 2025 GMT To Jan 5 08:37:45 2026 GMT
  Public Key: EC, 256 bit
  Cipher Suite: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  Protocol Version: TLSv1.3

Analysis:
The TLS handshake successfully established a secure channel between client and server using asymmetric encryption. 
The server sent its digital certificate for verification, containing Google's public key and issuer information. 
Once verified, both sides derived a shared session key using ECDHE and began encrypted communication.

Purpose:
TLS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.

Verification Note:
The error "unable to get local issuer certificate" appears because the local OpenSSL store does not include Google's full CA chain; this does not indicate a handshake failure.

Conclusion:
The HTTPS connection to google.com successfully used TLSv1.3 with AES-256-GCM encryption.
